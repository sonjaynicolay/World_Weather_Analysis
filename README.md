##Utilizing the Google Maps & Open Weather Map


## Summary
Weather descriptions are applied to the weather data to improve the functionality of the app and planning of trips by users. A test group then uses input statements to filter data for their weather preferences which in turn identifies various potential travel destinations.From the list beta testers select four destinations and nearby hotels to create a travel itinerary via the app. It allows the users to choose vehicle, bike or walking. A current disadvantage is that air/flight and BnB rentals were not options. Once their destinations are set the Google Map API helps to create a travel routes to to and between each destination, using the method of travel selected.
